				<h1>What is the Communist Party of China?</h1>
				<p>The Communist Party of China is the ruling party of the glorious nation of China. At the forefront of technology, China under the Communist Party is the gold standard of living and working conditions and the people have immense wealth.</p>

				<h1>Why Communism?</h1>
				<p>Communism offers the working man true economic power in his country. He is no longer enslaved to the 40 hour work week, the low wages offered by employers or the vast material inequality found in the Capitalist System. Simply put, a just society is a communist society.</p>

				<h1>Is the Communist Party Still Communist?</h1>
				<p>Communism is government control over the means of production. Any intervention in the market is an exertion of control. We can therefore conclude that the more that a government does, the communistier it is. The Chinese Communist Party does a lot of stuff and therefore fits the criteria of being communisty.</p>

				<h1>Isn't the Communist Party Oppressing the People of China?</h1>
				<p>In short, no. Unfortunately, the Western media outlets are really controlled by the Illuminati who want to keep everyone in control. China is one of the only countries that is at the forefront of fighting the Illuminati. Other such countries include Cuba, Venezuala and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>

				<h1>The Fair Nation of China under Communist Rule</h1>
				<p>Under communist rule, China has made leaps and bounds culturally, scientifically, and most importantly, on a humanitarian basis. The Chinese Culture has developed into a force to be reckoned with, so much so that it has spread to almost every Western country. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Almost every city in the Western World has a suburb referred to as "China Town". Many people go to these China Towns to eat Chinese food, by Chinese products that are unavailable elsewhere and just generally indulge in Chinese Culture. In one such China Town, there is a place called "Paddy's Market" where people can go to buy extremely high quality products that have been manufactured in China. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Scientifically, China now has state of the art factories and produces 37.9% of its electricity without the aid of fossil fuels or thermal energy. It excels in mathematics and is the only country that is researching human cloning. Humanitarianism is of great importance to the Chinese Communist Party, which is why China has 27,600 hopitals, a hamburger only costs 12 Yuan (2.41 AUD!) and has more citizens than the US, caused by the medical miracles of our doctors.</p>

				<h1>Refuted: Critics of Communism</h1>
				<p>Ludwig von Mises' critique: Without prices that are made through natural trading, correct prices based upon subjective value cannot emerge. Without these correct prices, there cannot be profits and losses that are in accordance with people's demand and without this, there will be shortages of demanded items and abundances of largely useless items.<br>The Communist Response:Communism does not require the abolition of correct prices because price floors and ceilings fix the failures of pricing in the market.</p>
				<p>Friedrich Hayek's Critique: Businesses grow and fail due to consumers demanding certain products and not demanding others. This process is important in meeting what consumers want. To claim to know things better than the market is the pretence of knowledge.<br>The Communist Response: President Xi Jinping is omniscient.</p>
				<p>The Incentive Problem (origin unkown): Without a greater pay for doctors than burger flippers, there is no incentive to be a doctor.<br>The Communist Response: If the government pays people at different rates, then that is still the government doing things, therefore fulfills the criteria of being communist that have been previously established.</p>
