				<h1>Rise to Power</h1>
				<p> Since the 1927 Shanghai massacre the Glorious CCP (Communist Party of China) had been at on and off war with the oppresive GMD (Kuomintang Party), after years of oppresion in 1949 the CCP showed it's absolute power and completely destroyed the GMD. God's chosen messaih Mao Zedong proclaimed infront of billions (Some people have tried to dispute this absolute fact but they are all wrong) of people in Tianemen Square, Bejing that "China Has Stood Up!" </p>

				<h1>Cultural Revolution</h1>
				<p>The Cultural Revolution is the concept of removing the corrupt captalistic traditions of the old prior "China" stuff like Religion, Enemies of the Glorious State and Food. The Cultural Revolution intends to replace such disgusting objects of worship with the one true object of worship, the messaih Mao Zedong. The Cultrual Revolution started May 1966 and finished succesfully in 1968 with the country thriving</p>

				<h1>China Thriving under Chairman Mao</h1>
				<p> While Mao was succesfully removing the horrible old traditions of China he was also succesfully leading the economy of China in ways never seen before, unemployment was still rampant despite the goverment needing more workers than ever, millions of people where starving and by the glorious end of the great leap forward Mao's wonderful leadership had single handedly killed 45 million people.</p>

				<h1>Deng Xiaoping's Reforms</h1>
				<p>Deng Xiaoping single handedly ruined Communist China, he introduced hated western inventions like a (sort of) working economy and food. He also introduced Term Limits in an attempt to put off a great leader like Mao rising again and ruling the country for over 50 years like Mao did. This concept is stupid and for this Deng Xiaoping is undoubtly the worst person to ever live in China.</p>

				<h1>Modern Day Communist Party</h1>
				<p> Modern day China isn't as good as it once was in Mao's day, however Xi Jinpings reforms have started to push it away from the mess Deng Xiaoping created and further towards Mao's vision, socially and politically atleast and economically less so as it seems sadly he isn't exactly interested in getting rid of food yet. Xi Jinping claims he wants to show the west that their way of doing things isn't the only way to do so and portray China as a wonderful alternative to democracy and capitalism. </p>

				<h1>Recent Reforms</h1>
				<p> The Chinese National People's Congress has recently voted for the removal of term limits, this means that it is now possible for Xi Jinping to rule for life. This law is vital for China achieving true communism under a new great leader in the future after Xi Jinping's death. </p>

				<h2>Future of China</h2>
				<p> Because of the recent reforms, In the long term I see a bright future for China. With a heavily communist leader (hopefully made immortal with future medicine). Ruling all of China undemocratically indefinetly, this would definetly be the best thing to happen to China since Mao Zedong took power. In the short term I see Xi Jinping succesfully combating the pollution which covers China succesfully and hopefully influencing atleast one western country to adopt the same wonderful undemocratic system China has.</p>
