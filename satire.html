				<h1>Is this Site Satire?</h1>
				This question while seemingly simple and easy to answer is actually a rather deep and strange one. I think truthly to understand whether this site is satire one has to look at what satire truthly is. 

				<h1>So what is Satire then?</h1>
				Google defines satire as "the use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues." but I personally believe there is much more to it than that. <br><br>According to the power of ridicule, satire was first defined as a genre by the Romans as “satura”. But the genre was very different to what it is today, Tales would be told with the intention of poking fun of things indeed but political change was never an aim of these. Ironically According to the power of ridicule itself, these works don’t fit under the modern version of satire because they don’t have any ulterior political motive. <br> <br> The power of ridicule states that their are 3 important requirements for something to be considered satire. The piece must have some form of critique. The critique must be stated implicitly and not overtly. And finally the piece must make use of irony.

				<h1>Alright, now answer the question</h1>
				Now I have outlined what satire is itself it’s clear the second step forward is asking whether this website on the Communist party of China is in fact satire. This website does seemingly fit a lot of the criteria but is the intention behind it truthly there, the answer is.
