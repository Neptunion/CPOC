				<h1>Critical Acclaim</h1>
				<p>"March of the Volunteers" (The Chinese National Anthem) has received critical acclaim from many Chinese musicians. In fact, President Xi Jinping considers its brilliance to have surpassed that of Beethoven, Bach and Palestrina combined.</p>

				<h1>Patriotic Emotions that the Anthem Inspires</h1>
				<p>March of the Volunteers has a very majestic tone, showing how China is truly the Galaxy's greatest nation (we know this because China has achieved light-speed space travel - even the great Democratic People's Republic of Korea has only landed a man on the sun). Even Mao has an imperfection, and his only mistake was temporarily changing the National Anthem to a different song, not understanding the true patriotic feelings inspired by March of the Volunteers.</p>

				<h1>Musical Influences</h1>
				<p>This great song needs no reference to musical influences; it is the true embodiment of perfect music. It does not pay homage to musicians, musicians pay homage to it.</p>

				<h1>Why the Anthem is Integral to Chinese Society</h1>
				<p>'March of the Volunteers' is integral to Chinese society because it binds the society together and unifies the Chinese people. A great scholar known as Naruto Uzumaki has frequently talked about bonds between friends making each other stronger, so imagine how the bonds between each Chinese citizen that the anthem creates strengthen China. You better believe it!</p>

				<h1>How the Anthem Continues to Inspire the Youth of China</h1>
				<p>In Western countries, silly and vapid pop music is the norm among youth. While China also has pop music, the youth of China know that their true allegiance lies to the Party and therefore value the Anthem above all other music. They use the anthem to channel their hard-working spirits to the greater good of the Chinese People and of the Party. <br> <br> Despite this the glorios government of China has still previously tried to allow the lowest form of Pop music, Rap music. The Chinese Youth Group sponsored a local rap group called CD Rev to make rap songs in English to tell foreigners how great China is. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLez-oqM1TTg34NMV58Y-YOmGLChsTNbrc">songs</a> (note: All these songs are inaccessible on our school accounts, presumably the illuminati trying to keep us from seeing the truth) are globally seen as extremely influential and some of the best rap songs ever created, mostly because did away with the whole rhyming thing. <br> <br> But alas this pop music still wasn't good enough for the Chinese Goverment to endorse it, so the sponsorship was cut and then when some disgusting non-state sponsored Chinese rap started to get popular the Chinese government out right banned rapping from appearing on television</p>

				<h2>The Chinese Anthem vs The US Anthem</h2>
				<p>The Chinese National Anthem is far superior to the US National Anthem because the US National Anthem is just pure propaganda.</p>
