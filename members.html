		<h1>Top Five Members of the Communist Party</h1>
			<h2>1) Chairman Mao</h2>
				<p>Quite frankly, we would have made Chairman Mao all ten members on the list before we realised that there is no way that he can stoop so low as to be second best. He has many accomplishments: the Cultural Revolution, the Barefoot Doctors and the successful rule of China for many years (no US President can claim to have ruled for as long as him). The greatest thing that he did for the Chineses people, though, was to just exist. To behold Chairman Mao is to behold the greatest glory to have graced the Earth. He may no longer be alive in the literal sense but he will always be alive in our hearts.</p>

			<h2>2) President Xi Jinping</h2>
				<p>He is by far the greatest living member of the Party: he has restored the pride of the Chinese people in a way not seen since Chairman Mao. He has unified China by imprisoning people who speak out against him, initiating a Social Credit system that awards people for being loyal to the party and disincentivises disloyalty and removing Presidential term limits. May he rule for many more years to come.</p>

			<h2>3) Qin Yizhi</h2>
				<p>As the first Secretary of the Communist Youth League of China, until September 2017 due to it being found that he was not properly elected, however that doesn't really matter in a good Communist System. What matters is the work that he had done. He was instrumental in the education of the Youth of China, teaching them the way of Communism and about how the Party knows best and we can only thank him for his hard work and serving the great nation of China well.</p>
			<h2>4) Xi Jinping</h2>
				<p>I already know what you're thinking: "Wasn't he already on this list?" The reason that he is on this list twice is because he does the work of two people. Even though he does his presidential work, he is also the Chairman of the Central Military Commision. His work with the People's Liberation Army 	is some of the most important work to be done within China. He helps fend off the evil capitalist United States of America, for which the Chinese people are indebted to him.</p>

			<h2>5) All-China Women's Federation</h2>
				<p>Yes, I realise this is not a person, however all people in China live under Communism and Communism unifies the people, so there can not be a distinction made between a person and a group of people. The All-China Women's Federation is an important part of the Women's Movement in China. The Chinese Communist Party were commited to women's rights even from their early days and so they have worked together, knowing that women can only be equal when all people are equal and that all people can only be equal when they live under Communism.</p>
